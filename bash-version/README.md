# jpas open and save as bash scripts

See the usage and idea from the [main README](../README.md).

## TODO

-   Bash scripts with no functions or other shenanigans, they are readable from
    top to down. Generally I don't like bash scripts, but since these scripts are
    supposed to be simple they are easier to understand than binaries with plenty
    of dependencies.
-   Bash scripts should not depend on other bash scripts.
-   Bash scripts should depend only on few known tools, currently `jq`, `gpg`.
-   I use shellcheck but it's just VSCode's defaults what ever those are.
